# find-something-to-do

About
This project allows users to find a random activity to do by making use of the free api bored-api

Get started
All you need to do to run this project is to clone the repo and open index file in your 
browser

Deprecated features
The api allows two more parameters 'price' and 'accessibility'. However they have
been removed as it was frequently returning with 'no activities found for given parameters'.
So I reduced the choice of parameters.
